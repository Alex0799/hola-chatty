# Chatty App

Welcome to Chatty! This is a real-time web-based chat application that you can use to talk to all of your friends.

## Getting started

### Running the app

TODO(jheroy): add Cloud9 specific instructions.

### Debugging (Chrome developer tools)

TODO(jheroy): add Cloud9 specific instructions for accessing console.

## Instructions

You can already send new messages to Firebase and see new messages from everyone
else in the console, but it will be more convenient for most users to see
messages in the provided `<textarea>`.

Your first task is to take Firebase messages from the message store and display them
in chatty's UI.

## Extra credit

- [ ] Change the color of your messages so you know which ones you sent versus
your friends (see styles.css)
- [ ] Add message timestamps so you can see *when* messages have been sent
(bonus points for something more descriptive than purely a date and time but
"10 minutes ago" or "1 day ago")
